# AndroidCodingChallenge

This repository contains a starter Android project for a **time-boxed coding interview**.

The project **builds and runs out of the box** and displays a placeholder screen.  
It is intentionally incomplete — during the interview, you will implement the missing
pieces to complete the challenge.

## ⏱ Timebox

**30 minutes**

You are not expected to finish everything perfectly.  
We care more about **architecture, decisions, and clarity** than polish.

## 🎯 Goal

Build a small Android app using **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM**, **Clean Architecture**, and **Hilt** that:

- Demonstrates clear separation of concerns

## 📡 API

Use **JSONPlaceholder** (no API key required):
